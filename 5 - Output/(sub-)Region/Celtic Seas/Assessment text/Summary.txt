The physical disturbance pressures from mobile bottom-contacting fishing gears varies spatially in the Celtic Sea sub-region, with 83% of the grid cells (I-2), and 53% of the surface area (I-3) <200m being fished on average per year for the period 2013-2018 (Table 1). Fishing is aggregated with 90% of the pressure occurring in 36% of grid cells (I-4). More intensive fishing occurs in the zone >200m depth in the Celtic Sea.

No longevity layer was available for the Celtic Sea region – declines in community biomass relating to impact cannot, therefore, be calculated for either the L1 or PD method.

Maps of spatial distribution of surface abrasion, economic value and weight of fisheries landings are shown in Figure 1. It is evident from the weight map that there is a mistake in the weights for the region, and weights are not presented in further analyses.  The value layer also appears incomplete.
