The distribution of fishing intensity in the Celtic Sea has a strong spatial variation (Figure 2), extending out in the west to the 1000 m. Fishing is mainly concentrated along the shelf edge, i.e. around the shelf and shelf-edge and on fishing grounds in the Irish Sea. Areas with lower intensity occur in parts of the central Irish Sea and in some coastal areas to the west of Ireland. 

The proportion of area subject to fishing pressure differs between broad-scale habitats and is highest in offshore circalittoral mud 99% of grid cells fished) and offshore circalittoral sand (93% of grid cells fished) (Table 2). Fishing intensity is highest in offshore circalittoral mud (average intensity = 3.67 year-1) and offshore circalittoral sand (average intensity = 1.91 year-1). 

Total fishing intensity is largely unchanged over time (Figure 3). However, there has been an increase in the intensity in upper bathyal sediment since 2016. Fishing intensity is relatively stable over time in circalittoral sand, abyssal areas, and offshore circalittoral coarse sediment. Average trawling intensity is more variable over time than the proportion of area fished (Figure 3, compare left and middle panel), but a single-year reduction was seen in most seafloor categories in 2017. Taken over the 10 year reporting period, this comparison shows that changes in intensity have not affected greatly the spatial distribution of the footprint.

Fishing pressure is aggregated, both at the regional level as well as at the level of the habitat (Figure 3, right panel). In all but abyssal areas, which are subject to a very small fishing footprint, the smallest proportion of habitat with 90% of effort varies between 20-48%. The intensively fished areas represent the ‘core fishing grounds’. These grounds contribute most of the landings and value (Figure 4). Almost 90% of the fishing effort (swept area) and 80% of the landings and value, occur in only 20% of the surface area of the Celtic Sea (Figure 4).
