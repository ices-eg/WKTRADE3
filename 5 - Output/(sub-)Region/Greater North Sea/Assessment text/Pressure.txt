The distribution of fishing intensity in the Greater North Sea has a strong spatial variation (Figure 2). Areas of higher intensity occur in the northern North Sea along the edge of the Norwegian Trench and in the eastern English Channel. Areas with lower intensity occur in the western part of the North Sea, and in the deeper parts of the Norwegian trench. 

The proportion of area subject to fishing pressure differs between broad-scale habitats and is highest in offshore circalittoral mud (99% of grid cells fished) and circalittoral sand (97% of grid cells fished) (Table 2). Fishing intensity is highest in upper bathyal sediment (average intensity = 9.17 year-1) and offshore circalittoral mud (average intensity = 3.16 year-1). 

Total fishing intensity is largely unchanged over time (Figure 3). There is a large peak in intensity in offshore circalittoral mud in 2016, which may be due to erroneous data. Fishing intensity is relatively stable over time in circalittoral sand and offshore circalittoral coarse sediment. The average trawling intensity is more variable over time than the proportion of area fished (Figure 3, compare left and middle panel). This shows that changes in intensity have not affected the spatial distribution of the footprint much.

Fishing pressure is aggregated, both at the regional level as well as at the level of the habitat (Figure 3, right panel). The smallest proportion of habitat with 90% of effort varies between 30-50%. The intensively fished areas represent the ‘core fishing grounds’. These grounds contribute most of the landings and value (Figure 4). Almost 70% of the fishing effort (swept area) and 60% of the landings and value, occur in only 20% of the surface area of the Greater North Sea (Figure 4).
