In this analysis, core fishing grounds are defined as the c-squares with the 90% highest value of landings in the VMS data. Figure 5 below show the percent distribution of the number of years c-squares are within the 90% highest value by metier. If fishing in a metier occurs in the same c-square every year with high value of landings, the bar at the right will be high, meaning that the c-square is within the 90% highest value of landings every year during the period 2013-2018. If a c-square is only within the 90% highest value in one year, it will end up in the bar at the left. The fisheries for small pelagic fish generally have a high variation in space.
