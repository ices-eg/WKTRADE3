The distribution of fishing intensity in the Greater North Sea has a strong spatial variation (Figure 2). Areas of higher intensity occur in the northern North Sea along the edge of the Norwegian Trench and in the eastern English Channel. Areas with lower intensity occur in the western part of the North Sea, and in the deeper parts of the Norwegian trench. 

The proportion of area subject to fishing pressure differs between broad-scale habitats and is highest in offshore circalittoral mud (99% of grid cells fished) and circalittoral sand (97% of grid cells fished) (Table 2). Fishing intensity is highest in upper bathyal sediment (average intensity = 5.61 year-1) and offshore circalittoral mud (average intensity = 3.24 year-1). 

Total fishing intensity has increased since 2016 (Figure 3). There was a large peak in intensity in offshore circalittoral mud in 2016. Fishing intensity is relatively stable over time in circalittoral sand and offshore circalittoral coarse sediment. The area within which fishing occurred (footprint) showed less variations in time (except for a decline in 2017). This shows that the overall increase in intensity has not affected the spatial distribution of the footprint much (Figure 3, middle panel).

Fishing pressure is aggregated in a relatively small part of the total footprint, both at the regional level as well as at the level of the habitat (Figure 3, right panel). 90% of the effort occurred in between about a third and half of the area. The intensively fished areas represent the ‘core fishing grounds’. These grounds contribute most of the landings and value (Figure 4). Almost 70% of the fishing effort (swept area) and 60% of the landings and value, occur in only 20% of the surface area of the Greater North Sea (Figure 4, red dot).
