The impact of mobile bottom-contacting fishing from the PD method shows the areas of highest fishing impact in the southern part of the Baltic Proper (Figure 8, left). High impact from the L1 method covers a much larger area (Figure 8, right) that mimics the map of fishing intensity.

The impact scores are largely constant over time (Figure 9, left panel). Impact varies between habitats (Figure 8 shows the four most extensive habitat types). Of these four habitat types, impact is highest in circalittoral sand and lowest in offshore circalittoral mud/sand. All habitat types (100%) have a PD impact score <0.2, whereas more than 70% of each habitat type has an L1 impact score <0.2.

Table 4 shows impact per métier relative to weight and value of landings. In this analysis, the different métiers are assessed for the grid cells that were fished by one MBCG métier, ignoring cells fished by other métiers. As such this estimates the maximum impact compared to the untrawled situation and the impact estimated assuming all other métiers to have impacted the habitat will be less than this. The métier with the highest impact (PD and L1) relative to the value and landings is the  seine trawl fishery for cod, haddock and flatfish (SSC_DMF). The dredge fishery for scallops (DRB_MOL) has the lowest impact per value and landings but note that only a very small area has been fished by this métier (Table 3).

Métiers differ in their habitat association and impact on each habitat type (Figure 10). Fishing impact on all broad-scale habitats are dominated by the otter trawl fishery (OT_ DMF). All other fisheries have little impact. The two impact indicators are typically showing similar qualitative patterns.
