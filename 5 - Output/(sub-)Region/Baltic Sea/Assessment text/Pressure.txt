The distribution of fishing intensity in the Baltic Sea is very localized (Figure 2). Areas of higher intensity occur in the south-western Baltic Sea (the south of the Baltic Proper, the Arkona and Bornholm basins). All other basins of the Baltic Sea are virtually unfished. 

The proportion of area subject to fishing pressure differs between broad-scale habitats and is highest in offshore circalittoral sand (75% of grid cells fished) and offshore circalittoral mud (62% of grid cells fished) (Table 2). The broad-scale habitats with the highest fishing intensity are: offshore circalittoral sand (average intensity = 1.78 year-1) and offshore circalittoral mud (average intensity = 1.62 year-1). 

Figure 3 shows the fishing intensity for the four largest MSDF broad-scale habitats. Total fishing intensity peaked in 2012, and has been steadily decreasing since then (Figure 3). This trend is driven by the fishing intensity circalittoral sand and circalittoral mud, with the fishing intensity in the other areas being relatively stable over time (Figure 3). The average trawling intensity is more variable over time than the proportion of area fished (Figure 3, compare left and middle panel). This shows that changes in intensity have not affected the spatial distribution of the footprint much.

Fishing pressure is highly aggregated, both at the regional level as well as at the level of the habitat (Figure 3, right panel). The smallest proportion of habitat with 90% of effort is less than 10%. The intensively fished areas represent the ‘core fishing grounds’. These grounds contribute most of the landings and value (Figure 4). Almost 90% of the fishing effort (swept area), landings and value, occur in only 10% of the surface area of the Baltic Sea (Figure 4).
