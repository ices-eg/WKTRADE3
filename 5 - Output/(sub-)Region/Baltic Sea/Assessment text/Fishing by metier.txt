Intensity, weight and value of landings are estimated for the grid cells that were fished by one MBCG métier, ignoring cells fished by other métiers (Table 3). 

The métier with the highest landings and value per area fished is the dredge trawl fishery for scallop (DRB_MOL) but note that only a very small area has been fished by this métier. The seines (SDN_DMF and SSC_DMF) have the lowest landings and value per area fished. This is followed by otter trawls that target cod and plaice (OT_DMF).
