ICES developed an assessment of fishing footprint of mobile bottom-contacting fishing gears (MBCG) and benthic impact that is appropriate for a six-year management cycle of MSFD assessments. The assessment maps and pressure and impact indicator values produced are based on an average fishing intensity of 2013-2018. This assessment period is linked to the latest available fishing data, rather than to the MSFD Art 8 assessment periods. The assessment product further shows year-to-year variation in pressure and impact from 2009. 

The assessment presents five pressure indicators and two benthic impact indicators by (sub-)regional, subdivision sea, or broadscale habitat type within that sea (Table 1), following ICES 2017 advice. The assessment further describes spatial and temporal variation of core MBCG fishing footprints. Lastly, the assessment describes a trade-off analysis between fisheries and the seafloor based on a management scenario where fishing effort is reduced through spatial closures in each broadscale habitat type.
