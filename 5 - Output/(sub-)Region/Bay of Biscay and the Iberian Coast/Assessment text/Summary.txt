The physical disturbance pressures from mobile bottom-contacting fishing gears varies spatially in the  Bay of Biscay and the Iberian Coast sub-region with 83% of the grid cells (I-2), and 66% of the surface area (I-3) being fished on average per year for the period 2013-2018 (Table 1) at depths <200m. Fishing is very aggregated with 90% of the pressure occurring in 47% of grid cells (I-4). In deeper areas, fishing is less intense. 81% of the grid cells (I-2), and 55% of the surface area (I-3) being fished on average per year for the period 2013-2018 (Table 1) at depths from 200 to 800m. Very little fishing occurs >800m depth.

The ICES methods for computing impact are not available at the moment in the region and therefore this part of the analysis has not been completed. 

Maps of spatial distribution of intensity, economic value and weight of fisheries landings are shown in Figure 1, although the map of economic value seems incomplete in the Iberian coast.   It is evident from the weight map that there is a mistake in the values for the region, and weights are not presented in further analyses.
