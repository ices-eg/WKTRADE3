The distribution of fishing intensity in the Bay of Biscay and the Iberian Coast has a strong spatial variation (Figure 2). Areas of higher intensity occur in the shallower part of the French Bay of Biscay, and across the shelf break of the wester Iberian peninsula, mainly in areas of Galicia and central and south Portugal. Areas with lower intensity occur in central Cantabrian Sea and in the Gulf of Cadiz.

The proportion of area subject to fishing pressure differs between broad-scale habitats and is highest in offshore circalittoral mud (97% of grid cells fished) and offshore circalittoral sand (96% of grid cells fished) and some other less extensive habitats (Table 2). Fishing intensity is highest in offshore circalittoral mixed sediment (average intensity = 6.25 year-1) and circalittoral coarse sediment (average intensity = 6.08 year-1). 

Total fishing intensity is largely unchanged over time (Figure 3). There is a large increase in intensity in offshore circalittoral sand and upper bathyal sediment in the period 2012-2014, which may be due to erroneous data. Fishing intensity is relatively stable over time in circalittoral sand and offshore circalittoral coarse sediment. The average trawling intensity is more variable over time than the proportion of area fished (Figure 3, compare left and middle panel). This shows that changes in intensity have not affected the spatial distribution of the footprint much.

Fishing pressure is aggregated, both at the regional level as well as at the level of the habitat (Figure 3, right panel). The smallest proportion of habitat with 90% of effort varies between 0-55%. The intensively fished areas represent the ‘core fishing grounds’. These grounds contribute most of the landings and value (Figure 4). More than 90% of the fishing effort (swept area) and more than 90% of the landings and value, occur in only 20% of the surface area of the Bay of Biscay and the Iberian Coast (Figure 4).
