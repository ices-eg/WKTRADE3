The distribution of fishing intensity in the “Northern area deep” has a strong spatial variation (Figure 2). Areas of higher intensity occur in the Galicia and northern Portugal coast as well as in the border between Spain and France. Areas with lower intensity occur in the central Cantabrian Sea and in the northern part of France. 

The proportion of area subject to fishing pressure differs between broad-scale habitats and is highest in several broad habitat such as offshore circalittoral mud (99% of grid cells fished), offshore circalittoral sand (99%) and offshore circalittoral coarse sediment (100%) (Table 2). Fishing intensity is highest in offshore circalittoral sand (average intensity = 2.96 year-1) and offshore circalittoral mud (average intensity = 2.30 year-1). 

Total fishing intensity is largely unchanged over time (Figure 3).  The average trawling intensity is more variable over time (showing a peak in 2015) than the proportion of area fished (Figure 3, compare left and middle panel). This shows that changes in intensity have not affected the spatial distribution of the footprint much.

Fishing pressure is aggregated, both at the regional level as well as at the level of the habitat (Figure 3, right panel). The smallest proportion of habitat with 90% of effort varies between 10-25% for the habitat with fishing (upper bathyal sediment) and between near 0 to 5% for all together but this percentages are highly affected for the large area of very deep seabed included in the analysis. The intensively fished areas represent the ‘core fishing grounds. These grounds seems to be very much aggregated than in other regions but again, these values are highly affected for the inclusion in the analysis of extent areas of unsuitable seabed (Figure 4).
