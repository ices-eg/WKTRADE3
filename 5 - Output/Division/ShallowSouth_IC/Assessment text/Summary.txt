The physical disturbance pressures from mobile bottom-contacting fishing gears varies spatially in the Western Iberian coast subdivision with 70 % of the grid cells (I-2), and 52% of the surface area (I-3) being fished on average per year for the period 2013-2018 (Table 1) at depths <200. Fishing is very aggregated with 90% of the pressure occurring in 36% of grid cells (I-4). 

The ICES methods for computing impact are not available at the moment in the region and therefore this part of the analysis has not been completed. 

Maps of spatial distribution of intensity, and weight of fisheries landings are shown in Figure 1.  It is evident from the weight map that there is a mistake in the weights for the region, and weights are not presented in further analyses.
