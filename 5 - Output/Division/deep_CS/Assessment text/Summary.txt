The physical disturbance pressures from mobile bottom-contacting fishing gears varies spatially in the offshore deep subdivision, with 81% of the grid cells (I-2), and 43% of the surface area (I-3) being fished on average per year for the period 2013-2018 (Table 1) at depths <200, and with 73% of the grid cells (I-2), and 49% of the surface area (I-3) being fished on average per year for the period 2013-2018 at depths from 200 to 800m. Fishing is aggregated with 90% of the pressure occurring in ~33 of grid cells (I-4). The offshore deep encompasses a considerable area below 800 m which is barely fished. 

No longevity layer was available for the Celtic Sea region – declines in community biomass relating to impact cannot, therefore, be calculated for either the L1 or PD method.

Maps of spatial distribution of surface abrasion, economic value and weight of fisheries landings are shown in Figure 1.  It is evident from the weight map that there is a mistake in the weights for the region, and weights are not presented in further analyses.
