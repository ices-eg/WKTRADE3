The distribution of fishing intensity in the “Northern Iberian coast” has a strong spatial variation (Figure 2). Areas of higher intensity occur in areas of northern Portugal and in the shelf break of Galicia and Asturias. Areas with lower intensity occur in the central Cantabrian Sea and in the shallowest areas (<100 m) since trawling in these areas is forbidden in this part of Spain. 

The proportion of area subject to fishing pressure differs between broad-scale habitats and is highest in several broad habitat such as offshore circalittoral mud (99% of grid cells fished), offshore circalittoral sand (97%) and offshore circalittoral coarse sediment (99%) and  Upper bathyal sediment (99%) (Table 2). Fishing intensity is highest in upper bathyal sediment (average intensity = 2.56 year-1) and offshore circalittoral mixed sediment (average intensity = 2.55 year-1). 

There is a large peak in intensity in most of the habitats, which may be due to erroneous data. Both average trawling intensity and proportion of area fished show a similar trend with a negative peak in 2010 and minor changes in the rest of years (Figure 3, compare left and middle panel). This shows that changes in intensity have not affected the spatial distribution of the footprint much. The pattern in Figure 3 suggests that there may be errors in the effort data.

Fishing pressure is aggregated, both at the regional level as well as at the level of the habitat (Figure 3, right panel). The smallest proportion of habitat with 90% of effort varies between 40-60% with the exception of circalittoral rock and biogenic reef although this is probably a mistake since there is not trawling on rock. The intensively fished areas represent the ‘core fishing grounds’. These grounds are aggregated reaching values of 70% of landings with only 30% of total area (Figure 4).
