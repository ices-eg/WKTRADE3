The physical disturbance pressures from mobile bottom-contacting fishing gears varies spatially in the “Southern area deep” subdivision with 74% of the grid cells (I-2), and 44% of the surface area (I-3) in areas at depths from 200 to 800m being fished on average per year for the period 2013-2018 (Table 1). Fishing is very aggregated with 90% of the pressure occurring in only 28% of grid cells (I-4). There is very little fishing beyond 800m depth.

The ICES methods for computing impact are not available in the region and therefore this part of the analysis has not been completed. 

Maps of spatial distribution of intensity, seafloor sensitivity and economic value and weight of fisheries landings are shown in Figure 1.  It is evident from the weight map that there is a mistake in the weights for the region, and weights are not presented in further analyses.
