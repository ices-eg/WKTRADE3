The figures and tables below show one implementation of multi-purpose habitat management through reductions in effort and spatial closures for the four most extensive MSFD habitat types. They show only the changes in average unfished area since changes in impact and average values were not available for this region.

The analysis is based on the progressive removal of 5 to 99% of all MBCG fishing effort, starting from the c-squares with the lowest effort (corrected for the areal extent of the MSFD habitat within each c-square). Blue dots show the current situation and are used as reference. The % of unfished area in the reference is only based on grid cells that are unfished. Note that the fraction of grid cells above/below a certain impact threshold initially remains the same (not shown) as the removal of effort starts from the c-squares with the lowest effort that typically have low impact.
