The distribution of fishing intensity in the “Bay of Biscay shallow” has a strong spatial variation (Figure 2). Areas of higher intensity occur in areas close to the coast, mainly in the central and norther part of the region. Areas with lower intensity occur in the western part of the region, in the deepest part of the study area. 

The proportion of area subject to fishing pressure differs between broad-scale habitats and is highest in several broad habitat such as offshore circalittoral mud (100% of grid cells fished), offshore circalittoral sand (98%) and offshore circalittoral coarse sediment (99%) (Table 2). Fishing intensity is highest in offshore circalittoral mixed sediments (average intensity = 8.36 year-1) and circalittoral coarse sediment (average intensity = 6.47 year-1). 

Total fishing intensity shows an increase over time (Figure 3). The mean fishing intensity increased during the study period for the offshore circalittoral mud and circalittoral sand, it keeps constant for offshore circalittoral coarse sediment and decreased for offshore circalittoral sand. The average trawling intensity is more variable over time (showing an increase) than the proportion of area fished (Figure 3, compare left and middle panel). This shows that changes in intensity have not affected the spatial distribution of the footprint much.

Fishing pressure is aggregated, both at the regional level as well as at the level of the habitat (Figure 3, right panel). The smallest proportion of habitat with 90% of effort varies between 45-65%. The intensively fished areas represent the ‘core fishing grounds’. These grounds are less aggregated than in other regions and it is necessary to reach values of 60% of surface area to reach values of 70% of landings (Figure 4).
