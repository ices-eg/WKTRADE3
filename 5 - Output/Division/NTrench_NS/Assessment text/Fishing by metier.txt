Intensity, weight and value of landings are estimated for the grid cells that were fished by one MBCG métier, ignoring cells fished by other métiers (Table 3). 

The métier with the highest landings and value per area fished is the beam trawl fishery for demersal fish (TBB_DMF) but note that the métier covers the smallest swept area among the active ones. The seines (SDN_DMF and SSC_DMF) have the lowest landings, but comparable ratios with the otter trawl métiers (OT_DMF and OT_CRU).
