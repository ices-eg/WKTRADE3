Core fishing grounds are defined as the c-squares with the 90% highest value of landings in the VMS data. Figure 5 shows the number of years c-squares are within the 90% highest value by métier.  If fishing in a métier occurs in the same c-square every year with high value of landings, the rightmost bar in Figure 5 and 6 will be high, meaning that the c-square is within the 90% highest value of landings every year during the period 2013-2018. If a c-square is only within the 90% highest value in one year, it will end up in the bar at the left. Figure 6 shows the percentage area overlap between the 90% highest value per year and the reference fishing ground. Both figures highlight that the otter trawl fishery for demersal fish (OT_DMF) and for crustaceans (OT_CRU) together with beam trawl fishery for demersal fish (TBB_DMF) are the most stable and overlapping over time. On the other hand, the core grounds of seines (SSC_DMF, SDN_DMF) and otter trawl for demersal fish (OT_SPF) have the highest variation in space.

Figure 7 illustrates the relationship between area fished in percent and the cumulated value of landings, sorted from the c-squares with highest value fisheries. The curves are generally starting steeply, illustrating the concentration of the fisheries at fishing grounds and the curves are ending horizontally, illustrating the peripheral fisheries going on outside the main fishing grounds.
