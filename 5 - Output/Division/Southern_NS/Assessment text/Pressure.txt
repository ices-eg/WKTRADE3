The distribution of fishing intensity in the Southern North Sea shows the most homogenous pattern among the Greater North Sea subdivisions, despite a certain level of spatial variation can still be found (Figure 2). Areas of higher intensity occur along the Belgian and Dutch coasts and few locations offshore.

The proportion of area subject to fishing pressure differs between broad-scale habitats and is highest in offshore circalittoral mud and offshore circalittoral rock and biogenic reef where 100% of the grid cells are fished. They are followed by offshore circalittoral sand and mixed sediments with 99% of the grid cells being fished. (Table 2). Fishing intensity is highest in offshore circalittoral mud (average intensity = 2.43 y-1) and circalittoral mud (average intensity = 2.28 y-1). 

Figure 3 shows the trends of fishing intensity, fished area and core-fishing ground coverage over time within the four most widely distributed broad-scale habitat type of the Southern North Sea. Total fishing intensity shows a decreasing trend from 2013 to 2018 for all broad-scale habitat except for offshore circalittoral mud (Figure 3, left panel). The decrease seems less pronounced for the proportion of area fished over time, thus only partially reflecting the decrease in intensity (Figure 3, middle panel). 

Fishing pressure remains aggregated to a largely constant extent over time, showing a similar pattern within each broad-scale habitat type (Figure 3, right panel). The smallest proportion of habitat with 90% of effort varies between a minimum of 20% and a maximum of 50%. These core-fishing grounds contribute to most of the landings and value. More than 60% of the landings are trawled within 20% of the total surface area, while the curve is less steep for the cumulative value (Figure 4).
