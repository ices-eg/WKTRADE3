Intensity, weight and value of landings are estimated for the grid cells that were fished by one MBCG métier, ignoring cells fished by other métiers (Table 3). 

The métiers with the highest value per area swept in the Southern North Sea are the beam trawl fishery for whelks, snails and scallop (TBB_MOL) and the dredges for mussel and scallop (DRB_MOL) despite a very small surface area was swept by both. The métiers targeting demersal fish species (OT_DMF, SDN_DMF and SSC_DMF) have the lowest value per area swept, although they are two of the most highest value métiers together with otter trawls targeting crustaceans (OT_CRU).
