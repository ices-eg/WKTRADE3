The impact of mobile bottom-contacting fishing from the PD method shows areas of relatively uniformly distributed low fishing impact across the whole Arkona and Bornholm Basin subregion (Figure 9, left). High impact from the L1 method covers the same area, but shows a higher impact (Figure 9, right).

The impact scores for PD was constant and low over time, whereas the L1 impact scores followed the fishing intensity more closely, and decreased over time (Figure 10, left panel). Impact does not vary much between habitats for the PD method (Figure 9 shows the four most extensive habitat types), but is much higher for the offshore circalittoral mud in the L1 method. All habitat types (100%) have a PD impact score <0.2, whereas more than 50-60% of the infralittoral sand, circalittoral mixed sediment and circalittoral sand have an L1 impact score <0.2. Only ~10% of the offshore circalittoral mud has an L1 impact score <0.2, and this fraction increases to 50% by 2018 (Figure 10).  

Table 4 shows impact per métier relative to weight and value of landings. In this analysis, the different métiers are assessed for the grid cells that were fished by one MBCG métier, ignoring cells fished by other métiers. As such this estimates the maximum impact compared to the untrawled situation and the impact estimated assuming all other métiers to have impacted the habitat will be less than this. Otter trawls for crustaceans (OT_CRU) have the highest value per impact in the Arkona and Bornholm Basin subregion (Table 3).

Impact by all métiers shows that otter trawls for cod or plaice has the highest impact for each habitat type (Figure 11).
