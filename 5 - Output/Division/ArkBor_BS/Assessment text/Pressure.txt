Fishing intensity is relatively well distributed across the Arkona and Bornholm Basin subregion  (Figure 2). 

The proportion of area subject to fishing pressure is high across most broad-scale habitats, apart from the infralittoral mixed sediments and infralittoral coarse sediment (< 50%) (Table 2). The highest fishing intensity is found in the offshore circalittoral mud (2.66 yr-1), offshore circalittoral mixed sediment (2.75 yr-1) and offshore circalittoral sand (2.20 yr-1) (Table 2). 

Figure 3 shows the fishing intensity for the four largest MSDF broad-scale habitats. Total fishing intensity peaked in 2012, and has been decreasing since (Figure 3). This trend is predominantly driven by the offshore circalittoral mud and circalittoral sand (Figure 3). The average trawling intensity has declined roughly in line with the proportion of area fished (Figure 3, compare left and middle panel). This shows that changes in intensity have also been linked to a decrease in spatial distribution of the footprint.

Fishing pressure is spatially distributed, both at the regional level as well as at the level of the habitat (Figure 3, right panel). The smallest proportion of habitat with 90% of effort is around 30%. The intensively fished areas represent the ‘core fishing grounds’. These grounds contribute most of the landings and value (Figure 4). More than 80% of the fishing effort (swept area), landings and value, occur in 20% of the surface area of the Baltic Proper (Figure 4).
