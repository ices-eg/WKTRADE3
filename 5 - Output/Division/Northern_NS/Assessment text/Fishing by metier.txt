Intensity, weight and value of landings are estimated for the grid cells that were fished by one MBCG métier, ignoring cells fished by other métiers (Table 3). 

The métier with the lowest landings and value per area fished are the seines (SDN_DMF and SSC_DMF). Otter trawl targeting crustaceans and demersal fish have intermediate landing and value per area swept (OT_CRU, OT_DMF). The highest value per area is given by dredges for mussels and scallops (DRB_MOL) although a limited area was swept compared to other active métiers.
