Core fishing grounds are defined as the c-squares with the 90% highest value of landings in the VMS data. Figure 5 shows the number of years c-squares are within the 90% highest value by métier.  If fishing in a métier occurs in the same c-square every year with high value of landings, the rightmost bar in Figure 5 and 6 will be high, meaning that the c-square is within the 90% highest value of landings every year during the period 2013-2018. If a c-square is only within the 90% highest value in one year, it will end up in the bar at the left. Figure 6 shows the percentage area overlap between the 90% highest value per year and the reference fishing ground. Majority of the active métiers in the Norther North Sea show consistent levels of variability in core fishing grounds among years with limited grid cells overlap. The métier that shows the most stability in core fishing ground over time is otter trawl for demersal fish (OT_DMF). 

Such temporal variability is reflected in Figure 7. Figure 7 illustrates the relationship between area fished in percent and the cumulated value of landings, sorted from the c-squares with highest value fisheries. The curves are generally starting steeply, illustrating the concentration of the fisheries at fishing grounds and the curves are ending horizontally, illustrating the peripheral fisheries going on outside the main fishing grounds.
