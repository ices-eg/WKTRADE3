The physical disturbance pressures from mobile bottom-contacting fishing gears greatly varies over space within the Northern North Sea subdivision with an average of 91% of the grid cells (I-2), and 57% of the surface area (I-3) being fished between 2013 and 2018 at an overall average intensity of 2.01 year-1 (I-1) (Table 1). A total of 9% of the grid cells are unfished and they mainly located north of the Dogger Bank and east of England. Fishing is aggregated with 90% of the pressure occurring in 38% of grid cells (I-4). 

The PD method shows an average decline in community biomass of 7% relative to carrying capacity across c-squares (I-6). A large proportion of c-squares, 91% (I-7), have an impact score less than 20%. The L1 method shows an average impact of 0.60 across c-squares (I-6). Only 23% (I-7) of the c-squares have impact scores less than 20% (I-7). The average impact calculated by the PD method is the lowest among the Greater North Sea subdivisions, with the largest proportion of grid cells impacted below 20%. The average impact calculated with the L1 method is still high, but high scores may be influenced by the high seafloor sensitivity linked to longevity, according to which the eastern half of the Northern North Sea has high sensitivity because of longevity classes above 6 years (Figure 1). 

Maps of spatial distribution of intensity, seafloor sensitivity and economic value and weight of fisheries landings are shown in Figure 1. Average value across the Northern North Sea shows a wide distribution of value but the largest proportion coming from the northern half of the subdivision. Landings show hotspots located along the Norwegian Trench and in several other spots offshore.

All impact estimates are for areas < 200 metre depth as there is no longevity prediction layer for deeper regions.
