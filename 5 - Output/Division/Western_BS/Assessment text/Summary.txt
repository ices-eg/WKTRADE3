The physical disturbance pressures from mobile bottom-contacting fishing gears is spatially variable across the western Baltic Sea subdivision with 61% of the grid cells (I-2), and 29% of the surface area (I-3), in the depth zone 0-200m, being fished on average per year for the period 2013-2018 (Table 1). Fishing is aggregated with 90% of the pressure occurring in 21% of grid cells (I-4). 

The PD method shows an average decline in community biomass of 2% relative to carrying capacity across c-squares (I-6). Virtually all c-squares (99% (I-7)), have an impact score less than 20%. The L1 method shows an average impact of 0.30 across c-squares (I-6) and only 61% (I-7), have impact scores less than 20% (I-7).

Maps of spatial distribution of intensity (surface abrasion), seafloor sensitivity and economic value and weight of fisheries landings are shown in Figure 1. Activity is mostly distributed across the southern  part of the western Baltic Sea subregion (Figure 1).
