Core fishing grounds are defined as the c-squares with the 90% highest value of landings in the VMS data. Figure 5 shows the number of years c-squares are within the 90% highest value by métier. Only three métiers are used in the western Baltic Sea subregion: otter trawls for cod and plaice (OT_DMF) and for small pelagic fish (OT_SPF), and seine for plaice and cod (SDN_DMF).  If fishing in a métier occurs in the same c-square every year with high value of landings, the rightmost bar in Figure 5 and 6 will be high, meaning that the c-square is within the 90% highest value of landings every year during the period 2013-2018. If a c-square is only within the 90% highest value in one year, it will end up in the bar at the left.
