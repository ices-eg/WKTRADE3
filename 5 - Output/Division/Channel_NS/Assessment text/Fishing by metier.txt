Intensity, weight and value of landings are estimated for the grid cells that were fished by one MBCG métier, ignoring cells fished by other métiers (Table 3). 

The métier with the highest landings and value per area fished is the beam trawl fishery for whelks, snails and scallop (TBB_MOL) and the dredge for mussels and scallop (DRB_MOL) despite smaller areas, especially for the beam trawl métier, were swept compared to the other métiers. The seines (SDN_DMF and SSC_DMF) have the lowest landings and value per area fished.
