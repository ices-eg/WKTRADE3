The physical disturbance pressures from mobile bottom-contacting fishing gears is spatially heterogeneous in the English Channel. The subdivision is intensely fished (average intensity = 4.15 year-1) with 95% of the grid cells (I-2), and 68% of the surface area (I-3) being fished on average per year for the period 2013-2018 (Table 1). The subdivision is almost completely fished, with only 5% of the grid cells being unfished. Fishing is aggregated with 90% of the pressure occurring in 41% of grid cells (I-4). 

The PD method shows an average decline in community biomass of 19% relative to carrying capacity across c-squares (I-6). The English Channel has the smallest portion of c-squares, 65% (I-7), with an impact score less than 20% compared to the other subdivisions of the Greater North Sea. However, the value might be influenced by the fact that almost the entire subdivision seafloor is impacted to some extent. The L1 method shows an average impact of 0.65 across c-squares (I-6). Only 18% (I-7) of the c-squares have impact scores less than 20% (I-7).

Maps of spatial distribution of intensity, seafloor sensitivity and economic value and weight of fisheries landings are shown in Figure 1. The seafloor sensitivity according to median longevity is among the lowest of the Greater North Sea as the predominant longevity class is 4-5 years. Highest value areas are located in the Bay of Seine and towards the eastern part of the channel. Highest landings come from the Bay of Seine.
