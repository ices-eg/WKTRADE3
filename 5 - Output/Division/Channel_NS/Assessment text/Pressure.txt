The distribution of fishing intensity in the English Channel highlights the highest SAR in the Bay of Seine and in the eastern part of the channel and the lowest SAR around the Channel Islands and northeast of them (Figure 2). 

The proportion of area subject to fishing pressure differs between broad-scale habitats but is above 80% for most of them. Grid cells within offshore circalittoral coarse sediments, offshore circalittoral mixed sediments and offshore circalittoral sand are 100% fished. (Table 2). Fishing intensity is highest in offshore circalittoral sand (average intensity = 6.43 year-1) and offshore circalittoral coarse sediments (average intensity = 5.46 year-1). The most extensive and most swept habitat is offshore circalittoral coarse sediments which outcome most of the landing and value. 

Total fishing intensity increased overall for all broad-scale habitats between 2013 and 2018 (Figure 3). The increase in fishing intensity does not correspond to an increased proportion of area fished which is generally stable over time. However, the proportion of area corresponding to 90% of the effort decreased over time, meaning that fishing pressure became more aggregated (Figure 3, right panel). 

Fishing pressure is aggregated, both at the regional level as well as at the level of the habitat (Figure 3, right panel). The smallest proportion of habitat with 90% of effort varies between 40-60%. Offshore circalittoral coarse sediment habitat is the most extensively fished over its surface however with the least aggregated fishing pressure. The core fishing grounds contribute to most of the landings and value in the English Channel. Both 60% of the landings and the value derive from 20% of its surface area (Figure 4).
