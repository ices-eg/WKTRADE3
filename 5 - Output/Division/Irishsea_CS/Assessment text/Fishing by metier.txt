Intensity, weight and value of landings are estimated for the grid cells that were fished by one MBCG métier, ignoring cells fished by other métiers (Table 3). 

The métier with the highest landings and value per area fished is fishing with dredges for scallops and mussels (DRB_MOL) and beam trawl for crustaceans (TBB_CRU). The seine fishery for demersal fish (SDN_DMF and SSC_DMF) and otter trawling for demersal fish (OT_DMF) have the lowest landings and value per area fished.
