The physical disturbance pressures from mobile bottom-contacting fishing gears varies spatially in the Irish Sea, with 78% of the grid cells (I-2), and 28% of the surface area (I-3) being fished on average per year for the period 2013-2018 (Table 1) at depths <200m. Fishing is aggregated with 90% of the pressure occurring in 17% of grid cells (I-4). 

No longevity layer was available for the Irish Sea subdivision – declines in community biomass relating to impact cannot, therefore, be calculated for either the L1 or PD method.

Maps of spatial distribution of surface abrasion, economic value and weight of fisheries landings are shown in Figure 1. It is evident from the weight map that there is a mistake in the weights for the region, and weights are not presented in further analyses.
