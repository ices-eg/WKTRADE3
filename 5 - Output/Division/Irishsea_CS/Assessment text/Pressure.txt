The distribution of fishing intensity in the Northern area subdivision has a strong spatial variation (Figure 2), with high concentrations of fishing effort occurring centrally and to the north in the Firth of Clyde. 

The proportion of the area subject to fishing pressure differs between broad-scale habitats and is highest in offshore circalittoral mud (100% of grid cells fished) and offshore circalittoral sand (97% of grid cells fished) (Table 2). Fishing intensity is highest in offshore circalittoral mud (average intensity = 6.33 year-1) and offshore circalittoral sand (average intensity = 0.75 year-1). 

Total fishing intensity remained unchanged over time with the exception of a strong, single-year decline in 2017 (Figure 3). This decline was evident across all habitats but was particularly marked in offshore circalittoral mud, and likely to represent a data error. Average trawling intensity was largely comparable to the proportion of area fished (Figure 3, compare left and middle panel). Taken over the 10 year reporting period, the proportion of area fished was seen to be stable with the exception of 2017.

Fishing pressure is aggregated at the level of the habitat (Figure 3, right panel). The smallest proportion of habitat with 90% of effort varies between 20-50%, with the exception of 2017 where a footprint < 10% was recorded in circalittoral coarse sediment. The intensively fished areas represent the ‘core fishing grounds’. These grounds contribute most of the landings and value (Figure 4). Roughly 90% of the fishing effort (swept area) and almost 80% of the landings and value, occur in only 20% of the surface area of the Irish Sea subdivision (Figure 4).
