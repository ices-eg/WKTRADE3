The distribution of fishing intensity in the Southern area subdivision is relatively evenly distributed (Figure 2), with a higher concentration of fishing effort occurring to the south of St George’s Channel. 

The proportion of the area subject to fishing pressure differs between broad-scale habitats and is highest in offshore circalittoral mud (100% of grid cells fished) and offshore circalittoral sand (100% of grid cells fished) (Table 2). Fishing intensity is highest in Offshore circalittoral coarse sediment (average intensity = 3.18 year-1), offshore circalittoral mud (average intensity = 3.98 year-1) and offshore circalittoral sand (average intensity = 2.29 year-1) and some other much smaller habitats. 

Total fishing intensity remained unchanged over time from 2016 - 2018 (Figure 3). This overlay larger variations within the individual habitat classifications, the most consistent across the habitat classes being a decline in 2010. Average trawling intensity is more variable over time than the proportion of area fished (Figure 3, compare left and middle panel), with the exception of a strong, single-year reduction in most seafloor categories in 2010 which is also evident in total fishing intensity. Taken over the 10 year reporting period, this comparison shows that changes in intensity have not affected greatly the spatial distribution of the footprint.

Fishing pressure is aggregated at the level of the habitat (Figure 3, right panel). In all but abyssal areas, which are subject to a very small fishing footprint, the smallest proportion of habitat with 90% of effort varies between 35-65%. Please note that this lower 35% is driven by the category 'unknown'. The intensively fished areas represent the ‘core fishing grounds’. These grounds contribute most of the landings and value (Figure 4). Approximately 55% of the fishing effort (swept area) and 50% of the landings and value, occur in only 20% of the surface area of the Northern area subdivision (Figure 4).
