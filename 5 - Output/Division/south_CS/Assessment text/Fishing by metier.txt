Intensity, weight and value of landings are estimated for the grid cells that were fished by one MBCG métier, ignoring cells fished by other métiers (Table 3). 

The métier with the highest landings and value per area fished is the beam trawling for molluscs (TBB_MOL). Note this is driven by a very small area. The seines (SDN_DMF and SSC_DMF) have the lowest landings and value per area fished.
