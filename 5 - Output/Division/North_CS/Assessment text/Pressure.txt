The distribution of fishing intensity in the Northern area subdivision has a strong spatial variation (Figure 2), with high concentrations of fishing effort occurring along the shelf edge. Areas with lower intensity occur in coastal waters to the northwest of mainland Scotland.

The proportion of the area subject to fishing pressure differs between broad-scale habitats and is highest in offshore circalittoral mud (99% of grid cells fished) and offshore circalittoral sand (93% of grid cells fished) (Table 2). Fishing intensity is highest in offshore circalittoral mud (average intensity = 3.67 year-1) and offshore circalittoral sand (average intensity = 1.91 year-1). 

Total fishing intensity remained unchanged over time until an elevation in 2016 - 2018 (Figure 3). This has been driven by an increase in the intensity in upper bathyal sediment, and, to an extent, offshore circalittoral sand, since 2016. Average trawling intensity is more variable over time than the proportion of area fished (Figure 3, compare left and middle panel), with the exception of a strong, single-year reduction in most seafloor categories in 2017. Taken over the 10 year reporting period, this comparison shows that changes in intensity have not affected greatly the spatial distribution of the footprint.

Fishing pressure is aggregated at the level of the habitat (Figure 3, right panel). In all but abyssal areas, which are subject to a very small fishing footprint, the smallest proportion of habitat with 90% of effort varies between 20-48%, with the exception of 2017 where a footprint < 10% was recorded in offshore circalittoral coarse sediment. The intensively fished areas represent the ‘core fishing grounds’. These grounds contribute most of the landings (Figure 4). More than 80% of the fishing effort (swept area) and 75% of the landings, occur in only 20% of the surface area of the Northern area subdivision (Figure 4).
