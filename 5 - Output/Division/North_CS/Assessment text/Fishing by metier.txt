Intensity, weight of landings are estimated for the grid cells that were fished by one MBCG métier, ignoring cells fished by other métiers (Table 3). 

The métier with the highest landings per area fished is the otter trawling for demersal fish species (OT_DMF). The seines (SDN_DMF and SSC_DMF) and otter trawling for crustaceans (OT_CRU) have the lowest landings per area fished. This is followed by otter trawls that target demersal fish (OT_DMF).
