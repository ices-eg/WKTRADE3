The physical disturbance pressures from mobile bottom-contacting fishing gears varies spatially in the nortern Celtic Seas subdivision, with 83% of the grid cells (I-2), and 53% of the surface area (I-3) being fished on average per year for the period 2013-2018 (Table 1) at depths <200m. Fishing is aggregated with 90% of the pressure occurring in 36% of grid cells (I-4). The area deeper than 200m is more intensely fished.  

No longevity layer was available for the Northern area subdivision – declines in community biomass relating to impact cannot, therefore, be calculated for either the L1 or PD method.

Maps of spatial distribution of surface abrasion, economic value and weight of fisheries landings are shown in Figure 1.  It is evident from the value map that there is a mistake in the weights for the region, and values are not presented in further analyses.
