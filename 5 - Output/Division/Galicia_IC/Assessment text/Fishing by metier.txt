Intensity, weight and value of landings are estimated for the grid cells that were fished by one MBCG métier, ignoring cells fished by other métiers (Table 3). 

The métier with the highest landings and value per area fished is the dredge fishery for clams  (DRB_MOL). The otter trawls that target crustaceans (OT_CRU) have the lowest landings and value per area fished.
