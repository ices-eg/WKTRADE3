Both the impact of mobile bottom-contacting fishing from the PD method and the L1 method have a strong spatial variability due to large unfished areas. In the fished areas, the impact scores are both extensive and high in value, especially in the northern area of Kattegat (Figure 8). 

The impact scores are largely constant over time (Figure 9, left panel). Impact varies between habitats (Figure 8 shows the four most extensive habitat types). Of these four most extensive habitat types, impact is highest in offshore circalittoral mud. Offshore circalittoral mud also has the least percentage of c-square where impacts are kept lower than 0.2 (below 25%).

Table 4 shows impact per métier relative to weight and value of landings. In this analysis, the different métiers are assessed for the grid cells that were fished by one MBCG métier, ignoring cells fished by other métiers. As such this estimates the maximum impact compared to the untrawled situation and the impact estimated assuming all other métiers to have impacted the habitat will be less than this. Active métier seems to all have high impact (PD and L1) relative to the value and landings. The otter trawl for small pelagic fish (OT_SPF) has the lowest impact per value and landings especially with the regards to the biomass impact indicator (Table 3).

Métiers differ in their habitat association and impact on each habitat type (Figure 10). In Kattegat, fishing impact is mostly located in the offshore circalittoral mud habitat due to otter trawl métiers targeting crustaceans and small pelagic fish (OT_CRU and OT_SPF). The second most impacted habitat by the above-mentioned métier is offshore circalittoral mixed sediments.
