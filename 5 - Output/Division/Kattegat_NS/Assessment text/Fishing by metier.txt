Intensity, weight and value of landings are estimated for the grid cells that were fished by one MBCG métier, ignoring cells fished by other métiers (Table 3). 

The métier with the highest landings and value per area fished is the otter trawl for small pelagic fish (OT_SPF). Otter trawl targeting crustaceans (OT_CRU) has the highest area swept but the least landing per area value.
