The physical disturbance pressures from mobile bottom-contacting fishing gears in the Kattegat is mostly homogenous in the depth zone 0-200m between 2013 and 2018. After excluding the area that cannot be fished because of shallow waters (0-10m) (39%) (I-5), the average fishing intensity is 1.17 y-1 (I-1). This consist of 61% of the grid cells (I-2), and 36% of the surface area (I-3) being fished on average per year (Table 1). The fishery has 90% of the pressure being aggregated in 26% of grid cells (I-4), but this has to be considered in light of the large portion of unavailable area for fishing.

The PD method shows an average decline in community biomass of 17% relative to carrying capacity across c-squares (I-6) of which 71% are calculated to have an impact lower than 20% (I-7). The L1 method shows an average impact of 0.40 across c-squares (I-6) of which 56% are calculated to have an impact lower than 20% (I-7), the lowest average score among the subdivisions of the Greater North Sea. Both indicators are influenced by the relevant portion of surface area where pressure data are not available. 

Maps of spatial distribution of intensity, seafloor sensitivity and economic value and weight of fisheries landings are shown in Figure 1. Seafloor sensitivity is very high in most of the Kattegat as the community longevity is mainly above 6-8 years. Total landing and value are mostly homogeneously distributed across the fished c-squares.
