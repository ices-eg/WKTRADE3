Multi-purpose habitat management with reductions in effort through spatial closures for the four most extensive MSFD habitat types. Figures and tables show the trade-off between average impact (PD, L1) or unfished area and fisheries values of landings based on a static analysis of effort removal. 

The analysis is based on the progressive removal of 5 to 99% of all MBCG fishing effort, starting from the c-squares with the lowest effort (corrected for the areal extent of the MSFD habitat within each c-square). Blue dots show the current situation and are used as reference. The unfished area in the reference only includes grid cells that are unfished. Average PD and L1 impact is a weighted averaged considering the areal extent of each MSFD habitat type within a grid cell. 

Note that the fraction of grid cells above/below a certain impact threshold initially remains the same as the removal of effort starts from the c-squares with the lowest effort that typically have low impact.
